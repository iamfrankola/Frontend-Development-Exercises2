            To make sure that you all succeed with this course, we have an online community of thousands of developers
            helping to answer questions and talk about all things programming and web development!
            Join by clicking here:
            A lot of companies use Discord to communicate across teams and is a valuable tool for you to learn as you
            become a developer. In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment this year, we
            are introducing a Discord online classroom where you can:

            - Introduce yourself
            - Ask the community questions
            - Get help with exercises
            - Meet other students around the world
            - Learn how to answer questions
            - Learn from each other
  </p>

  <p>
            Many students have said this is the best part of the course as you will feel like you are learning in a
            classroom rather than by yourself in front of a computer. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to
            ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. The Discord community
            should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of
            a programmer.
            I hope you find it useful. To join the group, go to this link here. Once there, you can sign up and click on
            channels to explore different topics.
            I'll see you in there, and let's make this year great!
